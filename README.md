# bastion-example

This project showcases the features of [bastion][], a command line tool that simplifies usage of a modern JavaScript toolchain. There aren't really many settings because bastion assumes a LOT of defaults, but you can find the custom config tweaks in `bastion.conf.js`.

Check out the `Makefile`, `bastion.conf.js` and the [bastion][] documentation for more information. You'll also notice that there's some Elm code seamlessly embedded in the JavaScript.

This repository has hot reloaded React and Elm side by side with a few very simple config lines that simply instantiate plugins.
